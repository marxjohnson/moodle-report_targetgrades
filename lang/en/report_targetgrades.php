If a set of ALIS statistics has been linked to a pattern matching a course, a Minimum Grade will be calculated for each student. The raw points score will be stored in the ALIS Points item, and the grade in the Minimum Grade item. The Target Grade will be left blank, to be filled in with an individual target for that student, using the Minimum Grade as a guide.

Courses marked with a * have no statistics linked to them, so will just have grade items added.';

An S indicates a below average sample size. This means that the statistics were calculated from a small number of actual grades.  Without knowing how many students took each subject, it\'s hard to determine confidence from sample size, so this indicator should be considered in the context of other indicators that may be present.

A C indicates low correlation (<0.3, where 0.6-0.7 is considered strong).  This means that the actual results gathered don\'t follow the line described by the statistics to a large degree.

A D indicates a high standard deviation.  This means that, while the trend of actual grades may match the line described by the statistics, the grades themselves are generally not on or close to the line itself.

Each of these indicators should be considered in context when deciding which subjects to calculate target grades for. For example, a below average sample size doesn\'t mean statistics should be automatically disregarded. However, where there is a combination of quality issues such as a very high standard deviation and a low correlation, it\'s unlikely that grades calculated from the statistics would have any meaning.';
